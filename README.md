This repository contains the projects I worked on using MATLAB GUIDE and Appdesigner. 

MATLAB started out with GUIDE (GUIDE stands for Graphical User Interface Development Environment) but MATLAB had announced that GUIDE will be removed in future software releases and will be replaced by Appdesigner.

GUIDE/Appdesigner provides the user with the tools to design user interfaces and create custom apps.
